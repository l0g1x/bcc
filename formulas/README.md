## Overview

BCC formulas define multi-step workflows for codebase analysis using TOML syntax.

## Formulas (WIP)

| Formula | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `explore-module` | Deep-dive into a module's structure | Draft |
| `analyze-api-boundary` | Map API surface and dependencies | Draft |
| `discover-and-dive` | Autonomous codebase exploration | Draft |
| `future-work-scaffold` | Generate future work beads | Draft |

## Usage

These formulas are designed to work with the Gas Town CLI (`gt`) and Beads IDE, but are not yet functional.
